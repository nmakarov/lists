# lists
Lists API server and React app tutorial


## Steps

### Step 1
Get'em started
something that works - countries list
adding filter and count

### Step 2
More data - adjectives
more filters
what about getting common adjective suffixes?
and what if I want just a flat list of those suffixes?
how long does it take to generate the response?

### Step 3
getting closer to the product (internal checks etc)
housekeeping: make linter happy
split code into modules
tests up and running
commands in package.js
making sure we have good coverage and eslint is happy with test definitions

### Step 4
Very important â€“ leap from a code to the product
Params validation
More tests
Error handling
Logger

### Step 5
Deployment
